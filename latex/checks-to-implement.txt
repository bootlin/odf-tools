- Look for http:// URLs not introduced by \url or \href
  find .  -name "*.tex" -exec grep -H "http://" {} ';' | grep -v url | grep -v href

  Caution: false positives in \verbatim sections

- Look for broken URLs

- Check spelling, look for typical spelling mistakes and typos
  - "the the", "informations", "an user", "root user" instead of "\code{root} user",
    "NULL" instead of "\code{NULL}", "return 0" instead of "return \code{0}" (outside
    \verbatim), "data is", "performances"
